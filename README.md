## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Atik

Born and raised in Bangladesh ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡© â€” Iâ€™ve always been more curious about how things work than whatâ€™s written in textbooks. While formal education had its place, I truly found my passion when I discovered computers and programming.

I'm a Software Architect and Team Lead with a deep love for system design, scalable architecture, and building impactful software solutions. Over the years, Iâ€™ve led high-performing teams and worked on projects that serve millions of users.

ðŸ”§ I specialize in:
- Distributed systems
- Microservices
- Scalable architecture
- API integrations
- Performance optimization

ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m also actively involved in the Bangladeshi tech community, where I enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me hanging out with friends, reminiscing about the good old days, or spending quality time with my family. Iâ€™m the proud father of a beautiful prince and princess.

Always a proud Bangladeshi ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©
