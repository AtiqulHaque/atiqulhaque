## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Atik

Born and raised in Bangladeshâ€”a land full of color, chaos, and stories. From an early age, I was more drawn to curiosity than classrooms. While I did go through the traditional education system, my real learning started when I discovered computers.

Formal education never quite clicked with me, but technology? That was love at first sight. I was fascinated by how code could solve real-world problems. Over the years, that fascination turned into a passion, and that passion became my profession. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed diving deep into system design, architecture, and building scalable solutions that make an impact.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m just a regular guy who loves spending time with friends, sharing laughs, and reminiscing about old hangout spots. Back in the day, you'd find me at our usual gathering places, talking tech, life, and everything in between. Some things change, but the love for good company and good conversations never fades.

Right now, Iâ€™m based in Bangladesh, working as a Software Architect and Team Lead. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on large-scale systems, leading talented teams, and collaborating on projects that touch millions of lives. Iâ€™m also deeply involved in the local developer communityâ€”because I believe that knowledge grows best when it's shared.

Above all, Iâ€™m a proud father.

And always, a proud Bangladeshi ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©.
